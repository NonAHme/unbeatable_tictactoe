# unbeatable_tictactoe
Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe playing AI written in python 2.7

This is my impossible-to-beat Tic Tac Toe playing AI. I didnâ€™t follow
any conventional algorithm (like minimax) while making this, I just
used my own Tic Tac Toe strategy and made corrections to the code in a
trial/error process. It does a great job of not losing to the human,
but there might be some bugs in there. I personally have never beaten
it, but If you find any ways to beat it let me know via Github or email
me at robbiebarrat@gmail.com
